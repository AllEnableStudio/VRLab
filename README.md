# VRLab
A VR laboratory project linked with Google Project Tango

   This programme is intended for education and it can be easily used in campus. The main idea of this project is to bring complex experiments to life without owning a expensive laboratory. VRLab can be a new concept of learning science such as physics and chemistry. All we want to do is to build a virtual environment for experiments to take place without a laboratory. Especially for schools or families.
